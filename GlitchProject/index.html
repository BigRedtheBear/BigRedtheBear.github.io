<h1>Glitch Art Project</h1>
	<p>This  project was focused on using manipulation of files code to produce interesting and artisitc results. My two peieces, "Turkey Shagothh" and "Heat and Ideal Static", use the glitch format to draw attention to current social and political issues. </p>

   <img src="heat and ideal static.png" >
    <p>"Heat and Ideal Static" is a critique of male beauty standards and the fuzzy, often contridictory ideals of masculinity. the images raw data was run through a distortion filter in a music editing program, giving rise to the warped amd multiplied variations of a conventionaly attractive male model. </p>

		<p> Turkey Shagothh is an examination of the duplicity of US senator Mitch McConnell. the duplication of mouths though repeated code represnet his ever shifting stances, while also refrencing the eldrish horror of shagothh, a being with many mouths who was a servant of darker powers. the code was also inundated with anti-facist slogans and the first chapter of mein kampf. </p>
