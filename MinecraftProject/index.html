	<p>This screenshot is from our minecraft project. We were tasked with using the games building tools to create art peices for export to 3D printing. In this project, I thought it would be interesting to use the popular modern game of mainecraft to create a chess piece. I belive chess to be a great example of the long history of games. Chess itself has been played in some iteration for most of recored history, and has its origins in the politics and warfare that has always informed the elite in society. I think the juxtuposition of such a symbol in a modern, creative videogame is striking. </p>
