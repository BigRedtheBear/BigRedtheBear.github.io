We were tasked to use P5JS, an artist oriented programing language, to create a simple drawing program. We populated it with custom drawing tools, and we were told to take the political nature of artist tools into account. For mine, i chose to address the ongoing issues of censorship by the Chinese Government. i created a set of stamps that built along the idea of incentivizing submission to their governments authority, imagining a art program that limited access to its tools based on perceived loyalty to the state. given the 'citizenship Score' program currently ongoing in china, this is closer to reality than is comfortable.  </p>
